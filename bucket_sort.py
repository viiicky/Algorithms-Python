# Bucket sort assumes that the input elements are distributed uniformly and independently over the interval [0,1)
# If n is the number of input elements, then
# it divides the interval into n equal sized buckets.
# As the inputs are assumed to be distributed uniformly and independently, we do not expect much crowd in a bucket.
# Worst case occurs when all the elements fall in a single bucket.
# Like radix sort, it also uses an intermediate sort to sort each bucket..
# Considering the intermediate sort to be insertion sort.
# Worst Running Time: theta(n^2)
# Average Running Time: theta(n)
