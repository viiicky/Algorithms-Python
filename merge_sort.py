# Merge sort is a comparison sort that uses a recursive technique, divide & conquer
# It means dividing the given problem, into subproblem of same instance recursively
# Until, we reach a base case where number of elements in the sub problem is only 1
# And because of the fact, that 1 element squence is already sorted we simply return.
# Once two subproblems are solved we combine their solutions to find the solution of the parent problem.
# Running Time: O(n lgn), where n is the number of elements to be sorted.
